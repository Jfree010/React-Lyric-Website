# ReactJS Lyric Website

This is a test website created to practice MERN stack development. It uses Reactjs as the front-end and Nodejs and Express as the back-end with MongoDB as the database.

This website is a Youtube Music inspired clone with basic functionality including:
- login/signup
- adding and removing favorite songs
- creating and editing playlists

the most complex feature is the sing-a-long mode which plays a CSS animation over the lyrics in time with the song. The various animations and syncing to the songs were done by me. 

Here's a link to a video demonstration of the website: https://youtu.be/FPY2hLnqjSY
